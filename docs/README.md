# Session Wizard

A modular web-based toolkit designed to help Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) and cognitive rehabilitation clinicians set therapy goals, track client progress, and collect session data. Created by Lucas James.

## Features

- **Goal Builder**: Unified SMART Goal composer + Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) table generator
- **Progress Monitor**: Document client progress across multiple therapy sessions (CSV import/export, print)
- **Therapy Session Data Taker**: Customize real-time data collection templates for various interventions
- **Homework Tracker**: Create customizable, printable home program logs with drag-and-drop components.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- Progressive Web App (PWA) - works offline and can be installed
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- No external dependencies - runs entirely in the browser
- Dark/light theme support

## Quick Start

1. **Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts a live server at `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Production**: Simply serve the files from any web server - no build step required

Desktop build
---------------
There is a minimal Electron wrapper under `session-wizard-desktop-build/` for creating a standalone Windows executable using `electron-builder`.

From PowerShell:

```powershell
cd session-wizard-desktop-build
npm install
npm run start    # to run the app
npm run build    # to create an installer (Windows)
```

Legacy/archived Electron and split tool folders are stored under `_archived_cleanout/` and excluded from active distribution.

## Maintenance & Contribution

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for coding standards, naming conventions, and service worker update procedure.

Typical maintenance workflow:
1. Add or modify tool assets under `tools/<tool-name>/`.
2. Bump `CACHE_NAME` + adjust `urlsToCache` in `service-worker.js` if new offline-critical files were added.
3. Smoke test each tool (load, print/export, clipboard features, offline reload).
4. Document noteworthy changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Offline Behavior

The service worker precaches the dashboard, shared assets, and each tool entry page. Dynamic user-entered content is not persistedâ€”export or copy/print before closing the page if you need a record.
